```
This Project mainly has 3 parts. One software part and two game parts.
The first game is a basic blocks breaking game similar to DX-BALL. In this game the player has to control a 
slide which bounce back a ball and the ball breaks any block it hits with. This continues until their is no 
blocks left. Currently we have only designed a single level in this game but we are planning to design more 
levels to make this game intresting.

The second game is a pattern matching game. At the starting of the game, the user got a brief moment of 5
seconds to memorise all the plate given in the level. Then the player can turn each plate to form a pair.
If the pair doesn't match the plate hides itself again. This conitnues until all the pair is found. SImilar
to the previous game, we have we have only designed a single level in this game but we are planning to 
design more levels to make this game intresting.

The software part of this project has a messenger application. In this application users can enter with a 
user and a password (Currently in development) to enter a virtual space where two or multiple users can 
interact with each other via sending messages.We are planning to add new features like sending photos,
audio etc in this application.
